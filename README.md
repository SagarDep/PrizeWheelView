# Prize Wheel View #

THIS SOFTWARE IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT


## About the library

This library is used on my [Chef Buddy](https://github.com/abicelis/ChefBuddy) app. It displays a rotating fling-able prize wheel, with settable sections (the little pizza shaped slices?). 
Whenever the wheel settles after being flung, the library notifies a listening class about the winning section. 

The sections can be programatically set, and they require a custom List of Section objects.
Please see the sample app *here*
